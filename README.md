# Crafting an Elegant Pricing Page for the iPhone 15

## The Design

I wanted to create a *clean, modern, and visually appealing* pricing page to showcase the new iPhone 15. 

The color palette aims for a *sleek, high-end look* using dark blues and greys contrasted with bright whites. I chose a large product image to highlight the phone's polished aesthetics. 

The layout focuses on drawing attention to the critical details - product name, tagline, price, features, customization options. I aligned these elements thoughtfully to optimize scannability.

To enhance legibility, I used a *large, bold title* and *prominent call-to-action button*. 

## Features

Some key features include:

- *Dynamic pricing* based on plan, currency etc. using JavaScript
- *Image swapper* to change the phone color using JavaScript
- *Responsive design* adapting layout for mobile
- Scroll-linked navigation menu
- Clean HTML semantics 

I also implemented:

- Bootstrap for responsive grid and styling
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Local fonts and icon packs for extra polish

## Challenges

- Getting the dynamic JavaScript pricing logic right took some iteration. 
- Tweaking the responsive breakpoints to optimize mobile experience.
- Balancing imagery, content density and white space.
- Cross-browser compatibility fixing display quirks.
